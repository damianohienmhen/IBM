You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/damianohienmhen/IBM/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Challenge Statement #4 - Power Consumption

```markdown
Florida has one of the largest per capita consumptions of energy in the United States. The bulk of this energy is drawn from fossil fuels leading to high carbon emissions. Currently there is a lack of public and private spending and initiatives in the Sunshine State for use of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind. 

Participants are invited to contribute to help develop applications for facilitating higher usages of renewable energy sources and optimize for efficient energy usage for all types of resources. 
 
How can we:
1. Analyze and target locations for renewable energy sources.
2. Optimize power generation to reduce overproduction.
3. Target and reduce areas of inefficient energy usage.
